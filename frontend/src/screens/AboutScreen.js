                            What is bidding?<br />

                            The Offering of prices for something, especially at an auction.<br />

                            A Bid is generally a process that an agency takes up in order to purchase
                            services (or) technologies from vendors.<br />

                            <br />Basic terminologies in bidding :

                            Auction
                            Auctioneer
                            bid
                            bid caller 
                            bid history
                            bid increment 
                            bidder
                            starting price 
                            bid time 
                                    We as a team want to implement this business system so that one can access bids 
                            from nowhere to anywhere. One can bid for any product without actually 
                            being there.<br />
                                    We had written a linkedin article regarding our business system which 
                            has survey form ,insights ,interviews ,user personas ,tools.<br /> 

                                    We have created login,logout pages and user interfaces using react and
                            other components .<br />
                                    
                                    This business system enables us to continue bidding without any third 
                            party being there.<br />
                                    
                                    We have also created payment gateway " <b>reckz coins</b> " which need to 
                            be acquired using real money which will reflect as reckz coins in user 
                            profile . One can bid for any product using these reckz coins.<br /> 

                                    We had also implemeted user stories which is an informal expression 
                            from end user.<br /></p>
